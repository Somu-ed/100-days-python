## Nesting

Nesting is where we put an `if` statement within an `if` statement using the power of indenting. The second `if` statement within the first `if` statement must be indented and its `print` statement needs to be indented one more time.

Pay attention to the vertical lines (as shown with the blue arrows in this image) to ensure your indents line up correctly.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you notice the second `if` statement below about `faveCharacter` and how it is indented?

```python
tvShow = input("What is your favorite tv show? ")
if tvShow == "peppa pig":
  print("Ugh, why?")
  faveCharacter = input("Who is your favorite character? ")
  if faveCharacter == "daddy pig":
    print("Right answer")
  else:
    print("Nah, Daddy Pig's the greatest")
elif tvShow == "paw patrol":
  print("Aww, sad times")
else:
  print("Yeah, that's cool and allâ€¦")
```

I highly doubt your favorite TV shows are Peppa Pig and Paw Patrol. Copy the code above and change it to match your favorite TV shows and characters.


## Common Errors

First, delete any other code in your `main.py` file. Copy each code snippet below into `main.py` by clicking the copy icon in the top right of each code box. Then, hit `run` and see what errors occur. Fix the errors and press `run` again until you are error free. Click on the ðŸ‘€ Answer to compare your code to the correct code.

### Syntax Error

ðŸ‘‰ What is wrong with the code below?

```python
tvShow = input("What is your favourite tv show? ")
if tvShow == "peppa pig":
  print("Ugh, why?")
  faveCharacter = input("Who is your favourite character? ")
  if faveCharacter == "daddy pig":
    print("Right answer")
else:
  print("Nah, Daddy Pig's the greatest")
elif tvShow == "paw patrol":
  print("Aww, sad times")
else:
  print("Yeah, that's cool and allâ€¦")
```

```python
else:
  print("Nah, Daddy Pig's the greatest")
```
is not indented properly.

- This `else` statement is referring to `faveCharacter` and therefore, both the above `else` and `print` statements need to be indented one time. Highlight them both and click 'tab' one time.

### Fake Fan Question Generator

Wanna find out if someone else is a true superfan of the same show, movie or interest as you? Create a program that asks what someone is interested in and includes nested if statements to ask annoying follow-up questions to see if someone is the real deal!

Make sure you include multiple if/elif statements and nested if statements too!
