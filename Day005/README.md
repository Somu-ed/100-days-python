## If Statements

These statements are a bit like asking a question. You are telling the computer: if something is true, then do this specific block of code. Double equals (`==`) is asking the computer to compare if these two things are ***exactly*** the same.

In the code below, I am asking `if` the variable `myName` is the same as the string `David`.

```python
myName = input("What's your name?: ")
if myName == "David":
```

### But that doesn't print anything?

To create a `print` statement related to the input from the if statement, you must go to the next line and indent **once** so it is all a part of the code we run.

👉 Copy this code and see what happens.

```python
myName = input("What's your name?: ")
if myName == "David":
  print("Welcome Dude!")
```

### What is else?

If the condition is not met with the `if` statement, then we want the computer to do the `else` part instead. Likewise, if the condition **is** met in the `if` statement, then the `else` bit is ignored by the computer. The `else` statement must be the first thing **unindented** after the `if` statement and in line with it

👉 Copy this code and give it a go. Watch those indents!

```python
myName = input("What's your name?: ")
if myName == "David":
 print("Welcome Dude!")
 print("You're just the baldest dude I've ever seen")
else:
 print("Who on earth are you?!")
```


## Common Errors

First, delete any other code in your `main.py` file. Copy each code snippet below into `main.py` by clicking the copy icon in the top right of each code box. Then, hit `run` and see what errors occur. Fix the errors and press `run` again until you are error free.

### Syntax Error
👉 What is wrong with this code below?

```python
catsOrDogs = input("Are you a cat person? Or a dog person?: ")
if catsOrDogs = "cat":
  print("Meow")
else:
  print("Woof")
```

- Our `if` statement must include `==` so it should read:
- `if catsOrDogs == "cat":`

### Syntax Error...again

👉 What is wrong with this code?

```python
catsOrDogs = input("Are you a cat person? Or a dog person?: ")
if catsOrDogs == "cat"
  print("Meow")
else:
  print("Woof")
```

- Our `if` statement is missing the `:`

### Indentation Error

👉 Do you see the error here?

```python
catsOrDogs = input("Are you a cat person? Or a dog person?: ")
if catsOrDogs == "cat":
  print("Meow")
else:
print("Woof")
```

As soon as you see a colon, the next line should be indented one more than the line above it.


## 👉 Day 5 Challenge

### "Which character are you?" Generator

You will need to:

1. Ask your users a series of questions that identify if they're one of the characters in the world you have created.
2. Add multiple `if` statements to check the result of each question.
3. Make sure to have a final `print` if they haven't selected any of the characters so far.

### Example

```
Marvel Movie Character Creator
--
Do you like 'hanging around'?: No
Then you're not Spider-man
Do you have a 'gravelly' voice?: No
Aww, then you're not Korg
Do you often feel 'Marvelous'?: Yes
Aha! You're Captain Marvel! Hi!
```
